|‚öΩÔ∏è[ Football  Data ETL Project](https://github.com/ykabir19/Data-Engineering/tree/main/Football_Data_Project)|2024| Python, MySQL, pandas, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks| This project is an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process, analyze, and store football player data. Using Python for data extraction and transformation, and MySQL for storage, the pipeline automates the ingestion of raw data from a CSV file, cleans and normalizes it, and loads it into a relational database. The structured database enables efficient querying and analysis of player performance, financial metrics, and national team data, supporting insights into player attributes and trends. This project serves as a foundational ETL solution for structured sports data analysis|

After calculating RFM scores for each customer, the K-Means algorithm is applied to group them into clusters, revealing patterns in customer activity. The project enables businesses to better understand their customer base and develop targeted marketing strategies. Data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations are performed using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib |
